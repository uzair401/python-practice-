# Tuples can accept any type of data. e.g
my_tuple = (1, 'Hello', True, 1.167)
# Tuples can also be created without paranthasies.
my_tuple = 1, 'Hello', True, 1.167
# you can count the occurance of a variable in the tuple using the .count() Funtion. e.g
print(my_tuple.count("Hello"))
#  You can find the index of the tuple usign the .index tuple. e.g
print(my_tuple.index(4.5))
# you can iterate the tuple using the loops.
# Tuples values cannot be changed. it is immutable.
